>>> Introduction <<<

This is a CUDA accelerated mining application which handle :

Raven (X16R)

where some of these coins have a VERY NOTABLE nVidia advantage
over competing AMD (OpenCL Only) implementations.

We did not take a big effort on improving usability, so please set
your parameters carefuly.

THIS PROGRAMM IS PROVIDED "AS-IS", USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

If you're interessted and read the source-code, please excuse
that the most of our comments are in german.

Example Files PreMade!
raven-pool-switcher.conf  -> Config file to switch pools or addresses to be used with -c in a .bat file
raven.conf                -> Config file to mine to a single pool to be used with -c in a .bat file
raven-pool-switcher.bat   -> Batch file to switch pool, edit and launch
raven.bat                 -> Batch file to mine to a single pool, edit and launch

Example for Raven Mining with a single gpu in your system
    Windows: RavenMiner-x64.exe -o stratum+tcp://pool.threeeyed.info:3333 -u <<WALLET>> -p rig1,stats
	Linux/OSX: RavenMiner-x64 -o stratum+tcp://pool.threeeyed.info:3333 -u <<WALLET>> -p rig1,stats
	
>>> Configuration files <<<

With the -c parameter you can use a json config file to set your prefered settings.
An example is present in source tree, and is also the default one when no command line parameters are given.
This allow you to run the miner without batch/script.

>>> API and Monitoring <<<

With the -b parameter you can open your RavenMiner to your network, use -b 0.0.0.0:4068 if required.
On windows, setting 0.0.0.0 will ask firewall permissions on the first launch. Its normal.

Default API feature is only enabled for localhost queries by default, on port 4068.

You can test this api on linux with "telnet <miner-ip> 4068" and type "help" to list the commands.
Default api format is delimited text. If required a php json wrapper is present in api/ folder.

I plan to add a json format later, if requests are formatted in json too..

>>> Solo Mining <<<

For solo-mining you typically use -o http://127.0.0.1:xxxx where xxxx represents
the rpcport number specified in your wallet's .conf file and you have to pass the same username
and password with -O (or -u -p) as specified in the wallet config.

The wallet must also be started with the -server option and/or with the server=1 flag in the .conf file


>>> Additional Notes <<<

This code should be running on nVidia GPUs ranging from compute capability
3.0 up to compute capability 5.2. Support for Compute 2.0 has been dropped
so we can more efficiently implement new algorithms using the latest hardware
features.

The recommended CUDA Toolkit version was the [6.5.19]http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/6_5/rel/installers/cuda_6.5.19_windows_general_64.exe but some light algos could be faster with the version 7.5 and 8.0 (like lbry, decred and skein).

>>> About source code dependencies <<<

This project requires some libraries to be built :

- OpenSSL (prebuilt for win)
- Curl (prebuilt for win)
- pthreads (prebuilt for win)

The tree now contains recent prebuilt openssl and curl .lib for both x86 and x64 platforms (windows).

To rebuild them, you need to clone this repository and its submodules :
    git clone https://github.com/peters/curl-for-windows.git compat/curl-for-windows


>>> Compile on Linux <<<

Please see https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/blob/linux/INSTALL

>>> Command Line Interface <<<

This code is based on the pooler cpuminer and inherits
its command line interface and options.

                        active frame rates (because it drives a display).
